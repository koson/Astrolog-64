# Astrolog-64
64-bit Astrolog for Linux (and sometimes Macs when I have access to one). If you need either a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of Astrolog for Windows, you should go get Walter Pullen's official release at his site (http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog.htm). You can find more information about Astrolog there or at the forum (https://groups.io/g/Astrolog) and Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/astrologprogram) pages.

Walter also has a github site now (https://github.com/CruiserOne/Astrolog) where you can also find the Windows versions.

The Linux and Mac (terminal only) versions compile for me with no problems and they will run a basic chart for you, but I do not do any kind of extensive testing of them. USE THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK.
