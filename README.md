# Astrolog-64
64-bit Astrolog. If you don't need a 64-bit version of Astrolog, you should probably just stick with Walter Pullen's official release at his site (http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog.htm). You can find more information about Astrolog there or at the forum (https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Astrolog_List/info) and Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/astrologprogram) pages.

Also, I have posted Linux and Mac (terminal only) versions. As far as I know, the Mac version works, but since I do not own a Mac I have no way to test it properly.
